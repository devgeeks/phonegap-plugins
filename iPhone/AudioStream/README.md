AudioStream
============

Installation
------------

This plugin allows you to use [Matt Gallagher's AudioStreamer classes](https://github.com/mattgallagher/AudioStreamer "Cocoa with Love does it again!") in your iPhone PhoneGap app.

Add the plugin much like any other:

1.      Add the AudioStream.m, AudioStream.h, AudioStreamer.h and AudioStreamer.m classes to your Plugins folder in Xcode
2.      Add the AudioStream.js file to your www folder
3.		Add the AudioStream.js to your html file. eg: `<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="AudioStream.js"></script>`
4.      Add the plugin to the PhoneGap.plist
5.      Here is where it differs slightly, [add the CFNetwork.framework to your project in Xcode](http://paikialog.wordpress.com/2011/03/09/xcode-4how-to-add-framework-into-project/ "Xcode 4â€“How to add Framework into project?").

### Example
```javascript
// Don't use these functions "as is", they're terrible. They just show the methods available.
// You should be doing something useful with the progress and the changes in state at the least.
function onDeviceReady()
{
	audioStreamer = window.plugins.audioStream;
	audioStreamer.setStreamType("mp3"); // only needed if your stream's type isn't auto-detected
}
function play(urlToStream)
{
	audioStreamer.play(urlToStream,playbackStateChanged,onError);
	navigator.notification.activityStart();
}
function stop()
{
	audioStreamer.stop(playbackStateChanged,onError);
}
function playbackStateChanged(state)
{
	console.log("state: "+state);
	switch (state) {
		case "isPlaying":
			navigator.notification.activityStop();
			progressTimer = setInterval("console.log(audioStreamer.progress + ' seconds')",300);
			break;
		case "isStopped":
			navigator.notification.activityStop();
			clearInterval(progressTimer);
			break;
		case "isWaiting":
			navigator.notification.activityStart(); 
			break;
		default:
		
}
function onError(error) {
	console.log(e.message);
}
```
